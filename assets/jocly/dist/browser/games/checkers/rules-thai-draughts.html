<p>In all Draughts variants, the following rules apply:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Players take turn by moving one piece</li>
	<li>Pieces can move to an adjacent empty position</li>
	<li>An adjacent opponent piece can be captured by jumping over it (which implies the next position is available)

	</li>
	<li>When possible, several captures can be performed at the same round (with the same piece)</li>
</ul>

	</li>
	<li>Pieces moves only on dark squares</li>
	<li>Simple pieces can only move forward, except for capture</li>
	<li>Promoted pieces, called kings, can move along any diagonal</li>
	<li>After a capture, a king must stop just after the captured piece</li>
	<li>White starts</li>
	<li>Capture is compulsory</li>
	<li>Captured pieces are removed immediately after the capture</li>
	<li>If a player must choose between several capture sequences, he can choose any sequence as long as it ends to a position where no more capture is possible</li>
	<li>If a piece reaches the last line during a capture sequence, it is not promoted, unless the capture finishes on the last line</li>
	<li>A player who cannot play any move loses the game</li>
	<li>After capturing a piece, king is allowed to fly in the opposite direction to capture another one</li>
</ul>
