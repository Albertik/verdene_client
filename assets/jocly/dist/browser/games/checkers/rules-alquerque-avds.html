No one knows for sure the exact rules of Alquerque, the ancestor of all Draughts variants.
<a href="http://www.draughtshistory.nl/OpeningEngels.htm" target="_blank">Arie van der Stoep</a> has worked on the history
of Draughts since the 1970s and proposed this interpretation which might well be the original rules.

<ul>
	<li>The board and initial position is the following:
		<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width:100%" src="{GAME}/res/rules/alquerque-start.jpg"/></p>
	</li>
	<li>Players take turn by moving one piece along the drawn lines</li>
	<li>Pieces can move to an adjacent empty position, either forward or sideway</li>
	<li>An adjacent opponent piece can be captured by jumping over it (which implies the next position is available)
		<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width:100%" src="{GAME}/res/rules/capture-alquerque.jpg"/></p>
	</li>
	<li>A piece reaching the opposite row is promoted to a king</li>
	<li>When possible, several captures can be performed at the same round (with the same piece)</li>
	<li>Captures can not be performed backward, except by a king</li>
	<li>A king can move along a line of free positions (long range king)</li>
	<li>After capturing, the king can stop at any free position after the captured piece (no king halt)</li>
	<li>A player not able to move any of his pieces loses the game</li>
</ul>

<p>Pieces: red vs black, promoted pieces have an extra white ring.</p>
