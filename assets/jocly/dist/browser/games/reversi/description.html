<p>Annexation is a turn-based game invented at the end of the 19th century.</p>

<p>The game is also known as Reversi or Othello.</p>
	
<p>It is generally admitted that "Othello" is a trademarked brand used to market this game and that "Reversi" is the game name to be used freely, and it is indeed named "Reversi" in many implementations around the Web. However, Ravensburger came to us, claiming the ownership of the "Reversi" brand and forbade us to name our implementation that way.</p>

<p>We decided to switch to the original name back in the late 19th century: Annexation.</p>
