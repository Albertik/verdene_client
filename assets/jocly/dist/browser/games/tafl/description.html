<p>Tafl games are old germanic and celtic board games. Tafl games in general are not well documented. We had to choose some rules but one of the exciting aspects of Jocly is to build communities around games. It is a great opportunity for lovers of ancient games to participate and interact, to propose ideas or correct mistakes we can make.</p>
<p>If you are an expert or just a fan of Tafl games, please use the <a href='http://www.jocly.com/forum/16' target='_blank'>dedicated forum</a> to share with us.</p>
