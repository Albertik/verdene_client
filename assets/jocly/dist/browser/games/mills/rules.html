<p>X represents the number of pieces (=men) you start with.</p>
<p>There are two phases in the game:
<ul>
<li><b>placing the men</b>: at each turn you put one men on an available position (=all intersections and corners)</li>
<li><b>moving men</b>: this phase starts when all the men are on the board. At your turn move one men from its position to an adjacent available position.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>I you are playing one of the "fly" variants, you can move a men to any available position (not only adjacent ones) <b>when you are reduced to 3 men</b>.
