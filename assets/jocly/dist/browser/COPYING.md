Copying Jocly
=============

Apart for the exceptions specified below, Jocly is released under the Affero
GNU Public License version 3.0 (AGPL v3).

In a nutshell, it means you can copy the Jocly source code, modify it and use it in 
your own projects, assuming the resulting work is released under the same license which 
implies, in particular, that you make the source code available. If the resulting work is running on a 
server and you do not distribute the software, you are still bound to this license (this
is the difference between AGPL and GPL). Read the joined AGPLv3 license file for details.

Exceptions
----------

If the AGPL license is not suitable for your application, Jocly is also available
under a proprietary license that may allow you to create derivative work that is not
subject to the AGPL restrictions. Contact us at license@jocly.com for more information.
