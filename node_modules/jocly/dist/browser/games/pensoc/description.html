<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that everybody loves seeing penguins sliding around on the ice. And soccer is the world's game, right? So 
take some cute families of penguins, give them an icy soccer field and a ball, and watch the slippery goodness that ensues.</p>

<p>Penguin Soccer is a game in the tradition of Chess, Checkers and Go. There are no dice, no cards, no random elements - only the skill of the two 
players. But instead of stern soldiers marching about a battlefield, or abstract stones on a grid, Penguin Soccer is about penguins sliding and spinning 
and chasing a soccer ball across a frozen field!</p>
