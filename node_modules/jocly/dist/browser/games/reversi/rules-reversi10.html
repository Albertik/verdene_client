<h1>Rules</h1>

<p>Two players called Dark (black) and Light (white). Each player puts one piece per turn on the board. The piece must be put on a space so that it sandwiches one or more of the opponent's lines (diagonal or vertical). The sandwiched disks are flipped to the color of the current player.</p>

<p>If a player can not play, he must pass his turn.</p>
