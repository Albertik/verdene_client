<h2>Variants</h2>

<p><b>Popout</b>: at your turn, you have the possibility to not add a token but to remove one of yours at the bottom of a column. All the upper tokens will then fall down one row.</p>

<p><b>5 in a row</b>: same rules apply, but you need to align 5 instead of 4 pieces. The initial board is not empty, both left and right columns are filled with alternated colors.</p>

<p><b>Torus</b>: in this game, the board is curved like a cylinder so that left and right cells become adjacent</p>
