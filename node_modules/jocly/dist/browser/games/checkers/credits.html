<p>History lost the name of those who invented the Draughts game base, but a few contributors deserve to be mentionned here:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Alfonso X of Castille (1221-1284) for writing the rules of Alquerque for the first time.</li>
	<li>Philip Mouskat (~1243) for mentionning the crowning rule.</li>
	<li>Robert Charles Bell (1917-2002) for his research in board games and draughts in general, and for proposing improvements to the rules of Alquerque.</li>
</ul>
