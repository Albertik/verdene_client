<p>In all Draughts variants, the following rules apply:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Players take turn by moving one piece</li>
	<li>Pieces can move to an adjacent empty position</li>
	<li>An adjacent opponent piece can be captured by jumping over it (which implies the next position is available)
		<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width:100%" src="{GAME}/res/rules/capture-alquerque.jpg"/></p>
	</li>
	<li>When possible, several captures can be performed at the same round (with the same piece)</li>
</ul>

<p>R.C. Bell proposed the additional Alquerque rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The board and initial position is the following:
		<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width:100%" src="{GAME}/res/rules/alquerque-start.jpg"/></p>
	</li>
	<li>Pieces moves along the drawn lines, forward or on the side, but not backward</li>
	<li>A piece cannot return to the position it just left</li>
	<li>A piece that reached the last row cannot move, except for capturing</li>
	<li>White starts</li>
	<li>Capture is compulsory</li>
	<li>Captured pieces are removed after all captures are done</li>
	<li>A player who cannot play any move loses the game</li>
</ul>
