<p><strong>Draughts (or Checkers in North America)</strong>: How old is it and what is its origin ?</p>

<p>Recent inquiries indicate 0-500 AD, in a civilization within the Roman sphere of influence, possibly on the territory occupied 
today by Spain, Italy and France.</p>

<p>The game was played at the alquerque board, then from the 14th c., on an unchequered or chequered board of 64 squares. 
In The Netherlands (?) the board was enlarged to 100 squares, second half 16th c. In the 19th c. it was enlarged to 144 squares.</p>

<p>The original king was short. Before 1000 AD the long king (the ability for a promoted piece to move along an entire line) was invented.</p>

<p>Originally, capture was free; in the 15th c. the obligation to take under penalty of the huff was introduced. 
In the 19th c. the huff was abolished: capturing became mandatory.</p>

<p>As a result of the changes, Draughts evolved from a strategic game to something where strategy and combination go hand in hand.
During the long evolution of the game, many different variants have been developed.</p>
